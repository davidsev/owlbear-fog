# Fog Painter

This extension adds four new tools for cutting or drawing fog:

- A "paint brush" tool that lets you paint fog shapes
- A "select cells" tool that reveals or fogs the squares / hexes you select
- A "lasso" tool that draws around a bunch of squares / hexes to reveal or fog them all
- A "reveal through fog" option that makes a token always visible, even if it's in the fog

The first three tools are in the main Fog toolbar, and the fourth is in the token context menu.

### Other

- The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidsev/owlbear-fog)
