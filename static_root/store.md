# Fog Painter

This extension adds four new tools for drawing fog:

- A "paint brush" tool that reveals fog as you draw
- A "select cells" tool that reveals the squares / hexes you select
- A "lasso" tool that draws around a bunch of squares / hexes to reveal them all
- A "reveal through fog" option that makes a token always visible, even if it's in the fog

The first three tools are in the main Fog toolbar, and the fouth is in the token context menu.

### Other
